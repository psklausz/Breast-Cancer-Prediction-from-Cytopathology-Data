# About The Data
The Breast Cancer (Wisconsin) Diagnosis dataset contains the diagnosis and a set of 30 features describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digitized image of a of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
+ radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter);
+ texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values);
+ perimeter;
+ area;
+ smoothness (local variation in radius lengths);
+ compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0);
+ concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour);
+ concave points (number of concave portions of the contour);
+ symmetry;
+ fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)
